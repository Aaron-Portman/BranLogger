How To Get A Week For A User
1. Start with userId and the year/month/day of the monday of the week you're looking for (may need to calculate Monday's date from today's date)
2. weekToUser.findOne() - for the document with matching userId, year, month, and day
3. Use the weekId of the weekToUser to do Week.findOne({ _id: weekId})
4. Use dayIds of week to find each day (day.findOne({ _id: dayId}))
5. Use dayOrder (array of dayId indexes) from weekToUser to determine the order of the week (i.e. what day corresponds to Monday, what day corresponds to Tuesday,...)
